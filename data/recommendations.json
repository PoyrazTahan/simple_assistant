  "recommendation_message": "English: Po, thanks for patiently answering all my questions! Based on what you've shared, I have a few personalized recommendations that can help you feel even better day to day:\n\n1. Since you're currently smoking, cutting back or quitting is one of the best steps you can take for your long-term health. Even reducing the number of cigarettes each day makes a difference\u2014you\u2019re stronger than you think!\n2. Your water intake is a bit low. Try to gradually increase your daily water to at least 1.5\u20132 liters. Hydration boosts your energy, mood, and even helps with concentration.\n3. Getting some gentle movement into your routine\u2014even short walks, stretching, or a couple of dance moves\u2014really supports energy and overall wellbeing.\n4. Regular health checkups are important for everyone, even when you feel fine. Scheduling one helps catch little things early and keeps you on track.\n\nIf you\u2019d like tips for any of these steps, just let me know! I\u2019m always here to support you on your wellness journey.\nTurkish: T\u00fcm sorular\u0131ma sab\u0131rla yan\u0131t verdi\u011fin i\u00e7in te\u015fekk\u00fcr ederim Po!

Sigara miktar\u0131n\u0131 azaltmak ya da tamamen b\u0131rakmak sa\u011fl\u0131k a\u00e7\u0131s\u0131ndan verebilece\u011fin en iyi karar olur.
