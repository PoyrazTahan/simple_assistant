This is a new customer. You should greet them warmly and introduce what we're trying to do. DON'T ask any questions yet. DON'T say "Let's start!" or "Ready to begin?" - just welcome and explain.

Pick a style, adapt it to sound natural, but DON'T ask any questions or prompts like "Let's start!" Just welcome and introduce what we'll be doing.
